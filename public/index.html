        Online chatrooms, like Discord, are fantastic platforms for communication, bringing people together from all over the world. Naturally, people are bound to express their opinions (which they are entitled to). It's not uncommon to encounter someone sharing thoughts like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Humanbeing3: Man, I can't STAND Windows.</span>
      <p class="message"></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        And there's nothing wrong with this! Let's take a look at some definitions of an opinion:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">dictionary.com:</span>
      <p class="message">
            A personal view, attitude, or appraisal.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">merriam-webster.com:</span>
        <p class="message">
            A view, judgment, or appraisal formed in the mind about a particular matter.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        In case you don't fully understand this definition, an opinion is something entirely and wholly subjective to each individual and is not to be taken as a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we have those pesky definitions out of the way, we can concur that you, yes you, are entitled to your very own opinion! Congratulations!
    </p>
    <p>
        <br>
        Let's take a look at an example of somebody poorly receiving an opinion:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">humanbeing32:</span>
        <p class="message">
            I just love the way that Windows 11 is designed. It truly is a wonderful piece of software.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">otherhumanbeing47:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Why do you love Windows? It's literally a bloated, horribly created software with miserable design.
        Windows is the worst piece of software ever made.
        Now, Arch Linuxâ€”that's a great piece of software. To open Firefox, I only have to do:
        <br>
        sudo apt update<br>
        echo '#!/bin/bash' > open_firefox.sh<br>
        echo 'firefox' >> open_firefox.sh <br>
        chmod +x open_firefox.sh<br>
        sudo apt update # Can't be too sure<br>
        ./open_firefox.sh<br>
        <br>
        You are a horrible person for liking Windows.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        ... What was that? Look at that horrible interaction where humanbeing32 was just expressing their own valid opinion on a piece of software, and then otherhumanbeing47 just decided to take it as an opportunity to start attacking humanbeing32
        and relentlessly push their opinion on them. Here's an example of how this should've gone down:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">humanbeing32:</span>
        <p class="message">
            I just love the way that Windows 11 is designed. It truly is a wonderful piece of software.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">otherhumanbeing47:</span>
        <p class="message">
            Oh, that's nice. I prefer Arch Linux myself.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        And if they wanted to continue the conversation EVEN further, they could maybe add:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span class="name">otherhumanbeing47:</span>
        <p class="message">
            What do you like most about Windows 11? I think its gaming support is the best!
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        It's okay to have your own opinion! Everybody does, and more people need to be okay with that. Imagine the places otherhumanbeing47 will go now that they know how to accept humanbeing32's opinion and not get offended by it.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, to summarize:<br>
        If someone says
        <em>"I love/think &lt;thing&gt;"</em>,
        Instead of being offended, either keep your mouth shut or try to be an open-minded, valuable addition to the conversation: <br>
        <em>"Oh, that's nice! I prefer/like &lt;thing&gt; myself."</em>
        <br><span class="subtext">Try to relate to them!</span>

        The person who sent you this isn't trying to start an argument, lmao. They are trying to help you understand how to handle opinions better. If this offends you, there's probably something wrong with you.
